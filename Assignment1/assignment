In this assignment, we will refresh our basic of DBMS and use PostgresSQL for an OSS project
that retrieves and downloads data from GitHub, called  GHTorrent . GHTorrent works by following
the Github event timeline and then retrieving all items linked from each event recursively and
exhaustively. To make monitoring and debugging easier, the GHTorrent maintainers use
extensive runtime logging for the downloader scripts.
